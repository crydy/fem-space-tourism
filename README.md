# Space tourism
This is a [solution](https://crydy.github.io/fem-space-tourism/) to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).


## More then usual

- Live stars move in space (on pages where you see planets - I created an additional layer with big planet on the first plan to overlap moving stars).
- Keyboard navigation developed in details - stylization (if navigation links get focus - underline width changing to mach outline width around the link), looping in the open mobile menu, tabindex managing, etc.
- JS checks if the browser supports webp, and replaces all the links for using the appropriate extension.
- Different transitions for texts and different images (small rotation of planet looks better than crew member rotation).
